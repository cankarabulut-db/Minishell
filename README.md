# - MiniShell - 

MiniShell is a command-line interface application that mimics the basic features of a Unix shell like Bash. This project was developed as part of the `42 School` program to strengthen fundamental system programming skills.  

## âœ¨ Key Features  

- **Command Execution**: Supports execution of external commands like `ls`, `echo`, `cat`, etc.  
- **Pipelines**: Handles commands connected with `|`.  
- **Redirections**: Input (`<`) and output (`>`), as well as append (`>>`).  
- **Environment Variable Management**: Dynamic environment variable handling.  
- **Built-in Commands**: Includes `cd`, `pwd`, `export`, `unset`, `env`, and `exit`.  
- **Signal Handling**: Graceful handling of `Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+D`, and `Ctrl+\`.  
- **Heredoc Support**: Implements `<<` functionality for inline input redirection.  
- **Minimalist Design**: Mimics Bash behavior while adhering to project rules.
